tsc -W                                    # run compiler with watch 
"start": "concurrently npm:start:*"       #tells concurrently to look on every script begins with start

const color  = 'red' 
color[0]               # r 
color[0] = 'Y'         # still -> red 

in javascript: 
"X" > "a"                      # false because sorting in this case relay on : 
"X".charCodeAt(0)              # 88 
"a".charCodeAt(0)              # 97  

while this is valid in js =>  typeof [ ]  # 'object'
but in ts it will allow you use typeof with primitive values only,  and instanceof for the other values
